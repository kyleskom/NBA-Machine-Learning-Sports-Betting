A machine learning AI used to predict the winners and under/overs of NBA games. Takes all team data from the 2007-08 season to current season, matched with odds of those games, using a neural network to predict winning bets for today's games. Achieves ~75% accuracy on money lines and ~58% on under/overs. Outputs expected value for teams money lines to provide better insight.
