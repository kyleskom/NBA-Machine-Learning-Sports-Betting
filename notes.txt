    Neural Network: We use four fully-connected layers, reducing the input of dimension 1524 to size 500, then 100,
    then 20, then finally a 1-dimensional output that predicts the Over- Under of the desired game (see Figure 2).
    We used a weight decay parameter of 1 to regularize the weights of the network,
    and a learning rate of 10−6 over 5000 epochs, using Gradient Descent.
    This allowed the network to roughly train to convergence (see Figure 5)

    When we were training the models, we found while we had data available starting from the 2007 − 2008 season,
    we achieved the highest levels of validation accuracy when the training dataset started from the 2012 − 2013 season
    rather than from the 2007 − 2008 season.
    This suggests that the earlier seasons are not very representative of the validation season
    (which was the 2016 − 2017 season) possibly because of the changing nature of the NBA
